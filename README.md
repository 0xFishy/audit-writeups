# 🛡️ Smart Contract Audit Writeups

This repository contains **security audit writeups, vulnerability research and protocol reviews** for Web3 smart contracts.

The goal of this repository is to document **real security issues**, explain their **root causes**, demonstrate **exploitation paths**, and propose **mitigations** following industry best practices.

## 👤 About Me

I'm an **independent Web3 security researcher** focused on smart contract auditing.

I review Solidity-based protocols with an attacker mindset, aiming to identify:
- critical vulnerabilities
- subtle edge cases
- broken assumptions
- unsafe protocol design decisions

Background as a Web3 developer allows me to reason about both **developer intent** and **real-world attack surfaces**.
